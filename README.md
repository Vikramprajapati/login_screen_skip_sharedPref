# 🚀 Flutter App: Skip Login Screen using SharedPreferences  

## 📌 Overview  
This Flutter app demonstrates how to **skip the login screen** after the first successful login using **SharedPreferences**. Once the user logs in, their status is saved, and they are automatically redirected to the home screen on the next app launch.  

## 🛠️ Features  
✅ Save user login status with SharedPreferences  
✅ Skip the login screen on subsequent app launches  
✅ Simple and efficient user experience

## 🏗️ How It Works  
1. **User logs in** → Save login status in SharedPreferences.  
2. **App restarts** → Check if the user is already logged in.  
3. **If logged in** → Navigate directly to the home screen.  
4. **If not logged in** → Show the login screen.
